      "imbalance reduction using the experimental data. Results: The mean electrode–skin impedance imbalance at 50 Hz was (37.6 ± 47.1) k𝛺and (15.0 ± 18.3) degrees using the Ag/AgClNSP electrode configuration; (4.52 ± 7.65) k𝛺and (4.6 ± 6.9) degrees using the Ag/AgClSP electrode configuration; and (36.2 ± 45.1) k𝛺and (3.4 ± 3.6) degrees using the Ag-SP electrode configuration. The compensation network resulted in a mean reduction in impedance imbalance over the bioelectrical signal range (1 Hz–500 Hz) of 284.3 k𝛺and 11.9 degrees; 4.6 k𝛺and 6.2 degrees; 86.7 k𝛺and 2.5 degrees for the Ag/AgClNSP, Ag/AgClSP and Ag-SP electrode configurations respectively. Conclusion: This study confirmed that the electrode–skin impedance imbalance can be large, and varies between subjects. Although abrasive skin preparation reduces the electrode–skin impedance imbalance, it does not guarantee a balanced electrode–skin interface, therefore, balancing the electrode–skin impedance using a compensation network has the potential to decrease bioelectrical signal interference. Significance: As bioelectrical signal interference is a function of electrode–skin impedance imbalance, to improve noise immunity of bioelectrical signal recordings, added compensatory impedance is required to balance the electrode–skin interface."

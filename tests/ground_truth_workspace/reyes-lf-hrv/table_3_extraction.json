  "reference_context": "rsching, & Reyes del Paso, 2013). Exclusively positive correlations between IBI and HRV in the three frequency bands arose. The positive linear \n\n\nassociation between LF power and IBI is definitely incongruent with the assumption of a sympathetic origin of the LF band. No systematic linkage between HRV and PTT—an index of b1-adrenergic influences on myocardial contractibility—was found (Table 3). The only significant association contradicted the expectations in the sense that LF power correlated positively with PTT assessed during letter cancellation as well as time reaction tasks. In the physical exercise study (Martín-Vázquez & Reyes del Paso, 2010), we used impedance cardiography in order to assess preejection period (PEP), one of the most reliable and valid noninvasive indicator of b1-cardiac adrenergic influences (McCubbin, Richardson, Langer, Kizer, & Obrist, 1983; Sherwood et al., 1990). No associations were found between HRV and PEP (Table 4). In another study we compared patients suffering from fibromyalgia with matched healthy controls in parameters of autonomic cardiovascular control (Reyes del Paso, Garrido, Pulgar, Martín-Vázquez, & Duschek, 2010). Again, the reanalysis of these data revealed no associations between PEP and HRV (Table 4). It has been argued that left ventricular ejection time (LVET) constitutes a specific indicator of chronotropic sympathetic tone (Uijtdehaage & Thayer, 2000). Given its inverse relationship with sympathetic tone, one may predict negative correlations between LVET and LF power.",

## table_0 (p3) — Table 1. Means and Standard Deviations (in Parentheses) of HRV Parameters Before... [6 cols × 12 rows]

- **Caption:** Table 1. Means and Standard Deviations (in Parentheses) of HRV Parameters Before and After Pharmacological Blockade
- **Notes:** IBI, VLF, LF, HF are sub-group header rows spanning the full table width; other columns in those rows are empty. BL = baseline. The last column header contains two effect sizes: one for BL comparison (LB) and one for Task comparison. Note at bottom of table: BL = baseline, IBI = interbeat interval, VLF = very low frequency, LF = low frequency, HF = high frequency.
- **Verified:** false

|  | BL (pre drug) | Task (pre drug) | BL (post drug) | Task (post drug) | η² (LB), η² (Task) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| IBI |  |  |  |  |  |
| Atropine | 938 (126) | 871 (122) | 563 (29) | 550 (38) | .906, .870 |
| β-blocker | 876 (136) | 845 (134) | 1129 (155) | 1109 (156) | .980, .992 |

## table_1 (p4) — Table 2. Means and Standard Deviations (in Parentheses) of HRV Parameters of Phy... [6 cols × 12 rows]

- **Caption:** Table 2. Means and Standard Deviations (in Parentheses) of HRV Parameters of Physically Active (A) and Sedentary (S) Participants in the Martín-Vázquez and Reyes del Paso (2010) Study during Baseline and a Mental Arithmetic Task
- **Notes:** IBI, VLF, LF, HF are sub-group header rows spanning the full table width; other columns in those rows are empty. A = Physically Active, S = Sedentary. F, p, and η² values appear only once per parameter group (on the A row), reflecting the interaction effect; S rows have empty values for those columns. HRV was analyzed by adaptive autoregressive models.
- **Verified:** false

|  | Baseline | Task | F(1,39) | p | η² |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| IBI |  |  |  |  |  |
| A | 820 (93) | 753 (76) | 5.86 | .020 | .283 |
| S | 733 (126) | 690 (100) |  |  |  |
| VLF |  |  |  |  |  |
| A | 279 (218) | 172 (114) | 3.75 | .060 | .183 |

## table_2 (p6) — Table 3. Correlations of HRV Parameters Obtained by Fast Fourier Transformations... [5 cols × 14 rows]

- **Caption:** Table 3. Correlations of HRV Parameters Obtained by Fast Fourier Transformations with Interbeat Interval (IBI), Pulse Transit Time (PTT), and Baroreflex Sensitivity (BRS) Recorded during Baseline (BL) and Cognitive Load (Task) in the Duschek, Muckenthaler, et al. (2009; Panel A, n = 60) and Duschek et al. (2013; Panel B, n = 54) Studies
- **Notes:** Panel A and Panel B are sub-group header rows; other columns in those rows are empty. IBI-BL and IBI-Task rows have empty IBI column because correlation of IBI with itself is not reported. The raw text at this bbox location contains PEP (Pre-Ejection Period) rows, not PTT rows, despite the caption mentioning PTT. This is the actual content at the table's spatial location on page 6 (right column). * denotes statistical significance; + (superscript) denotes marginal significance.
- **Verified:** false

## table_3 (p6) — Table 4. Correlations of HRV Parameters Obtained by the Autoregression Technique... [5 cols × 14 rows]

- **Caption:** Table 4. Correlations of HRV Parameters Obtained by the Autoregression Technique with Interbeat Interval (IBI), Pre- Ejection Period (PEP), and Baroreflex Sensitivity (BRS) in the Physical Exercise Study (cf. Table 2) by Martín-Vázquez and Reyes del Paso (2010; Panel A, n = 40) and in the Chronic Pain Study by Reyes del Paso, Garrido, et al. (2010; Panel B, n = 64)
- **Notes:** Panel A and Panel B are sub-group header rows; other columns in those rows are empty. IBI-BL and IBI-Task rows have empty IBI column because correlation of IBI with itself is not reported. The raw text at this bbox location contains PTT (Pulse Transit Time) rows, not PEP rows, despite the caption mentioning PEP. This is the actual content at the table's spatial location on page 6 (left column, lower). * denotes statistical significance; + (superscript) denotes marginal significance. Note at bottom: BL = baseline, Task = mental arithmetic, VLF = very low frequency, LF = low frequency, HF = high frequency.

- **Notes:** Note at bottom of table: SPD = spectral power density in the range 0 to 0.40 Hz, that is, total power. VLF = very low frequency, LF = low frequency, HF = high frequency. LFnu and HFnu are normalized units.
- **Verified:** false

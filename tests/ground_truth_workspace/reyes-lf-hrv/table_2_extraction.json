  "reference_context": "sion) revealed no or even negative correlations between LF oscillations and muscle sympathetic nerve traffic (Adamopoulos et al., 1992; Kingwell et al., 1994; McGowan et al., 2009; Notarius et al., 1999). Neuroimaging techniques such as positron emission tomography and single photon emission computed tomography provide for quantitative assessment of innervation of the left ventricular myocardium. These methods were applied in a number of studies investigating the linkage of LF and the LF/HF ratio with sympathetic innervation. None of them, however, revealed positive results (Haensch, Lerch, Jorg, & Isenmann, 2009; Moak et al., 2007; cf. Goldstein et al., 2011, for a review). \n\nIt also seemed worthwhile to examine associations of LF oscillations with IBI and other cardiodynamic indices that are thought to be influenced by the sympathetic system. Tables 3 and 4 display the results of reanalyses of studies that provide evidence on this issue. Table 3 also includes data taken from a very recent study in which 54 young participants performed a 15-min simple time reaction task after a 5-min baseline period (Duschek, Wörsching, & Reyes del Paso, 2013). Exclusively positive correlations between IBI and HRV in the three frequency bands arose. The positive linear \n\n\nassociation between LF power and IBI is definitely incongruent with the assumption of a sympathetic origin of the LF band. No systematic linkage between HRV and PTT—an index of b1-adrenergic influences on myocardial contractibility—was found (Table 3).",

  "reference_context": "itz et al., 1991; Zhong, Jan, Ju, & Chon, 2006). \n\nThe following results were obtained by reanalysis of a study of our own on HRV effects of pharmacological vagal and sympathetic blockade. Six healthy participants were assessed twice in a seated position. They received atropine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.) on Day 1 and the b _1_ -selective b-blocking agent metroprolol (10–15 mg i.v.) on Day 2 or vice versa. Before and after drug application, cardiovascular parameters were obtained at rest and during a memory search and counting task. HRV was analyzed by means of fast Fourier transformations (FFT) using the software Kubios HRV (version 2; Niskanen et al., 2004). Drug effects on the three frequency bands are shown in Table 1, and Figures 1 and 2 display corresponding spectral profiles. Atropine administration was followed by HRV decrease in all three frequency bands (all _ps_ < .05). This held true for the baseline (reductions of 94.7%, 98.7%, and 99.8% for VLF, LF, and HF oscillations, respectively) and task periods (reductions of 93.5%, 98.7%, and 99.4%, for VLF, LF, and HF oscillations, respectively). As can be seen in Figures 1 and 2, HRV in the entire spectrum almost disappeared. The administration of the b1-blocker showed only slight effects on HRV. During task execution HRV increased somewhat.",

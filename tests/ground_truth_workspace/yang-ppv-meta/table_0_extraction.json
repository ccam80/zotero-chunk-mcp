Data on tidal volume, spontaneous breathing, and body weight were not available in some studies (Table 2). Most studies did not report the respiratory rate (Table 2). All of the included studies excluded patients with cardiac arrhythmia. With regards to fluid challenge, 6% hydroxyethyl starch (HES) was most commonly used (n = 13), followed by crystalloids (n = 6), other colloids (n = 2), and blood (n = 1). A volume ranging from 100 ml to 20 ml/kg body weight was infused within 1 minute up to 90 minutes. Cardiac output was monitored by means of PiCCO technology (n = 7), pulmonary artery catheter (n = 6), transesophageal/transthoracic echocardiography or Doppler measurements (n = 5), and other methods (n = 4). All studies except for two [24,26] defined responders as patients whose stroke volume or cardiac output was increased by ≥15%. \n\n**==> picture [342 x 342] intentionally omitted <==**\n\nFigure 1 Flowchart of study selection.

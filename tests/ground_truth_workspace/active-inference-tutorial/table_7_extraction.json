Before running this script, remember to make sure SPM12 is installed and that the ‘DEM’ folder within the SPM folder structure is added as a path in MATLAB (...spm12\\toolbox\\DEM). \n\nBased on the current model specification, a representative plot of simulation results is shown in Fig. 8A. This and similar plots are generated from specific output fields in the MDP structure (Table 3 describes each output field). The two panels in the top-left of Fig. 8A show posteriors over states _at the end of the trial_ (i.e., the states the model believes it was in at each time point _τ_ when at the last time point _t_ ). Here time goes from left to right, darker indicates higher probability, and the cyan dots denote the true states. Here, the model believes it was in the ‘leftbetter context’ and that it chose to take the hint and then chose the left slot machine.",

Model variable*
General definition
Model specification for explore–exploit task (described in
detail Section 3)
oτ
Observable outcomes at time τ.
Outcome modalities:
1. Hints (no hint, hint-left, hint-right)
2. Reward (start, lose, win)
3. Observed behavior (start, take hint,
choose left, choose right)
sτ
Hidden states at time τ. One vector of possible state values
for each state factor (i.e., each independent set of states; e.g.,
visual vs. auditory states).
Hidden state factors:
1. Context (left machine is better vs.
right machine is better)
2. Choices (start, take hint, choose left, choose right)
π
A vector encoding the distribution over policies reflecting the
predicted value of each policy. Each policy is a series of
allowable actions in a vector U, where actions correspond to
different state transitions (i.e., different Bπ,τ matrices) that can
be chosen by the agent for each state factor. Policies are
chosen by sampling from this distribution.
Allowable policies include the decision to:
1. Stay in the start state
2. Get the hint and then choose the left machine
3. Get the hint and then choose the right machine
4. Immediately choose the left machine (and then
return to the start state)
5. Immediately choose the right machine (and then
return to the start state)
A matrix: p(oτ |sτ )
A matrix encoding beliefs about the relationship between
hidden states and observable outcomes at each time point τ
(i.e., the probability that specific outcomes will be observed
given specific hidden states at specific times). Note that in the
POMDP structure typically used in the active inference
literature (and which we describe in this tutorial), the
likelihood is assumed to remain constant across time points in
a trial, and hence will not differ at different values for τ
(although one could adjust this if so desired). The likelihood is
also assumed to be identical across policies, and so there is no
indexing with respect to π.
When there is more than one outcome modality, there is one
A matrix per outcome modality. When there is more than one
state factor, these matrices become high-dimensional and are
technically referred to as tensors. For example, a second state
factor corresponds to a third matrix dimension, a third state
factor corresponds to a fourth matrix dimension, and so forth.
Encodes beliefs about the relationship between:
1. Probability that the hint is accurate in each context
2. Probability of reward in each context
3. Identity mapping between choice states and
observed behavior
Bπ,τ matrix: p(sτ+1|sτ , π)
A matrix encoding beliefs about how hidden states will evolve
over time (transition probabilities). For states that are under
the control of the agent, there are multiple Bπ,τ matrices,
where each matrix corresponds to one action (state transition)
that the agent may choose at a given time point (if consistent
with an allowable policy). When there is more than one
hidden state factor, there is one or more Bπ,τ matrices per
state factor (depending on policies).
Encodes beliefs that:
1. Context does not change within a trial
2. Transitions from any choice state to any other
are possible, depending on the policy.
C matrix: p(oτ |C)
A matrix encoding the degree to which some observed
outcomes are preferred over others (technically modeled as
prior expectations over outcomes). When there is more than
one outcome modality, there is one C matrix per outcome
modality. Rows indicate possible observations; columns
indicate time points. Note that each column of values in C is
passed through a softmax function (transforming it into a
proper probability distribution) and then log-transformed
(using the natural log). Thus, preferences become
log-probabilities over outcomes.
Encodes the stronger preference for wins than losses. Wins
are also more preferred at the second time point than the
third time point.

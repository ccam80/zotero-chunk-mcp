The active inference framework, and in particular its recent formulation as a partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP), has gained increasing popularity in recent years as a useful
approach for modeling neurocognitive processes. This framework is highly general and flexible in
its ability to be customized to model any cognitive process, as well as simulate predicted neuronal
responses based on its accompanying neural process theory. It also affords both simulation experiments
for proof of principle and behavioral modeling for empirical studies. However, there are limited
resources that explain how to build and run these models in practice, which limits their widespread
use. Most introductions assume a technical background in programming, mathematics, and machine
learning. In this paper we offer a step-by-step tutorial on how to build POMDPs, run simulations using
standard MATLAB routines, and fit these models to empirical data. We assume a minimal background
in programming and mathematics, thoroughly explain all equations, and provide exemplar scripts that
can be customized for both theoretical and empirical studies. Our goal is to provide the reader with the
requisite background knowledge and practical tools to apply active inference to their own research.
We also provide optional technical sections and multiple appendices, which offer the interested reader
additional technical details. This tutorial should provide the reader with all the tools necessary to use
these models and to follow emerging advances in active inference research.

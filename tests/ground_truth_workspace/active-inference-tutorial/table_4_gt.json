The second equation shows this same expression in terms of the elements in the POMDP model used in this tutorial (i.e., in matrix notation).\nExpected free energy evaluates the value of each policy based on their expected ability to: (1) generate the most desired outcomes, and (2) minimize uncertainty about hidden states. Achieving the most desired outcomes corresponds to minimizing the KL divergence between preferred observations, p(o|C) = C\u03c4, and the observations expected under each policy.\nMinimizing uncertainty corresponds to minimizing the KL divergence of the likelihood (E\u1d37\u1d40[H[p(o|\u03c0)]]) = \u2212diag(A\u1d40 ln A) \u00b7 s\u03c4,\u03c0. Note that the diag( ) function simply takes the diagonal elements of a matrix and places them in a row vector. This is simply a convenient method for extracting and operating on the correct matrix entries to evaluate the entropy, H[p(o|\u03c0)] = \u2212\u2211 p(o) ln p(o|s), of the distributions encoded within each column in A.

If the value of winning money in C\u03c4 is high enough (i.e., if p(o|C) is sufficiently precise), this will deter the agent from choosing to ask for the hint.\nThe \u2018ambiguity\u2019 term \u2212 E\u1d37\u1d40 [H[p(o|\u03c0)]] = \u2212 diag(A\u1d40 ln A) \u00b7 s\u03c4,\u03c0 \u2212 drives the agent to minimize uncertainty by asking for the hint."],

The second equation shows this same expression in terms of the elements in the POMDP model used in this tutorial (i.e., in matrix notation). Marginal free energy has a slightly different form than the expressions for VFE that are also shown in the text (and which have been used in many previous papers in the active inference literature). This updated form improves on certain limitations of the message passing algorithms described in minimization of VFE (see Section 2.3; also see Parr, Markovic, Kiebel, & Friston, 2019).\nMarginal free energy evaluates the evidence that inferred states provide for each policy (based on new observations at each time point). See the first two rows in this table on updating beliefs about states for an explanation of how each term in the equation relates to Bayesian inference.", "This would encode the amount of surprise (given a choice of policy) when observing a hint or a win/loss after selecting a specific slot machine."]

  "reference_context": "_m_ and �2 _f_ indicate coregulation because they represent the degree of lagged dependence in RSA beyond one’s own RSA response (i.e., beyond the effect of �1 _m_ and �1 _f_ ).[1] All models were fitted using SAS PROC MIXED (SAS Institute Inc., 2011), which accounts for the within- and between-couple variability in the outcome variable (Thiébaut, Jacqmin-Gadda, Chene, Leport, & Commenges, 2002). \n\n## **Results** \n\n## **Testing the Presence of RSA Coregulation** \n\nCoregulation was defined as dependence between partners’ physiological responses within an optimal bound. In the context of the model presented in Equation 1, the existence of coregulation implies that �0 and �2 (for both men and women) will be larger in the conversation tasks, indicating both an increase in average RSA and a greater dependence between partners in those tasks. A series of nested models was constructed to test these hypotheses. The comparison of model fit for each of these models is available in Table 1. Models 1–3 tested for mean differences in average RSA from baseline to conversation, Models 4 and 5 tested for differences in the autoregressive and cross-partner effects between baseline and conversation tasks, and Models 6 and 7 tested for gender differences for the autoregressive and cross-partner effects. All models were fitted using maximum likelihood to make nested statistical comparisons via �[2] difference testing. \n\nThe first three models tested an increase in RSA for men and women from the baseline to the conversation tasks.",

## table_0 (p5) — Table 1 Comparisons of Model Fit for Different Tests of Coregulation [5 cols × 7 rows]

- **Caption:** Table 1 Comparisons of Model Fit for Different Tests of Coregulation
- **Notes:** Note (footnote, not transcribed as row): Models 1–7 are described in the text. −2 LL = the models −2 log-likelihood; df = the number of parameters estimated in the model; Δ-2 LL = the difference between the prior and current model; p = the probability of Δ-2 LL, with p < .05 indicating better fit of the model with more parameters; df = degrees of freedom.
- **Verified:** false

| Model | −2 LL | df | Δ-2 LL | p |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 4393.8 | 7 | — | — |
| 2 | 4387.3 | 8 | 6.5 | 0.01 |
| 3 | 4387.3 | 9 | 0.0 | 1.00 |
| 4 | 4377.1 | 10 | 10.2 | <0.01 |
| 5 | 4373.1 | 11 | 4.0 | 0.04 |

## table_1 (p6) — Table 2 Coefficients From Best-Fitting Cross-Lagged Panel Model (Model 6) [6 cols × 14 rows]

- **Caption:** Table 2 Coefficients From Best-Fitting Cross-Lagged Panel Model (Model 6)
- **Notes:** The image shows the caption continuation '(Model 6)' at the top. 'Baseline' and 'Conversation' are sub-group headings appearing as rows with content only in the Task column; other columns in those rows are empty. Coefficient subscripts use m (male) and f (female). Note (footnote): β₀ = the average RSA throughout the task; β₁ = the degree of autocorrelation; β₂ quantifies the level of cross-partner correlation; subscripts m and f = male and female, respectively.
- **Verified:** false

| Task | Coefficient | Estimate | SE | t | p |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Baseline |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | β₀ₘ | 6.30 | .12 | 50.42 | <.01 |
|  | β₁ₘ | .62 | .03 | 18.88 | <.01 |
|  | β₂ₘ | −.01 | .03 | −.08 | .93 |

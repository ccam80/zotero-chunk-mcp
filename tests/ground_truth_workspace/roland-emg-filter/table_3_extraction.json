All filters are stable, as the absolute value is <1 in all implementations. For FIR filters, stability is given in all cases. For IIR filters, poles closer to the origin of the unit circle are preferred in the implementation because oscillations abate more rapidly. The selected 5 Hz Butterworth comb filter fully meets the stability requirements. \n\ncases.

- **Caption:** Table 1. Definitions of the tuple (Ω; Ψ; S; A; Λ; p; q) underlying active inference.
- **Notes:** Single-column definition table with no header. 7 rows, one per element of the tuple (Ω, Ψ, S, A, Λ, p, q). Dotted lines between rows, continuation lines indented. PDF text layer maps Greek glyphs to Latin codepoints: Ω→V, Ψ→C, Λ→L, ω→v, ψ→c, λ→l, and uses ð/Þ for parentheses, ! for →, [ for ∈. GT uses intended mathematical notation. The extraction bbox only captured the caption area; actual table body extends from y≈80 to y≈300.
- **Verified:** false

| a sample space Ω or non-empty set from which random fluctuations or outcomes ω ∈ Ω are drawn |
| external states Ψ : Ψ × A × Ω → R states of the world that cause sensory states and depend on action |
| sensory states S : Ψ × A × Ω → R the agent's sensations that constitute a probabilistic mapping from action and external states |
| action states A : S × Λ × Ω → R an agent's action that depends on its sensory and internal states |
| internal states Λ : Λ × S × Ω → R the states of the agent that cause action and depend on sensory states |
| ergodic density p(ψ; s; a; λ\|m) a probability density function over external ψ ∈ Ψ, sensory s ∈ S, active a ∈ A and internal states λ ∈ Λ for a system denoted by m |
| variational density q(ψ\|λ) an arbitrary probability density function over external states that is parametrized by internal states |

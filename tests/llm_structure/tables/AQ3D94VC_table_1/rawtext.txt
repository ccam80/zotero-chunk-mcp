including LF HRV (Cook et al., 1991; Jokkel et al., 1995). The
latter effect was actually interpreted as indicating that LF consti-
tutes a marker of vagal activity (Cook et al., 1991). Montano et al.
(1994) stated that for the assessment of sympatholytic action of
b-adrenergic blocking agents, HRV has to be expressed in normal-
ized units or in terms of the LF/HF ratio. In our study, however,
metoprolol did not signiﬁcantly alter LFnu (from 47  10 to
52  20 during baseline and from 52  20 to 47  11 during cog-
nitive load), HFnu (from 53  10 to 48  19 during baseline and
from 48  20 to 53  11 during cognitive load) and the LF/HF
ratio (from 0.95  0.36 to 1.14  0.39 during baseline and from
1.75  2.04 to 0.93  0.38 during cognitive load).
Studies using nonpharmacological blockade procedures also
raise doubts about the sympathetic origin of the HF band. Hopf,
Skyschally, Heusch, and Peters (1995) and Introna et al. (1995)
investigated the effects of preganglionic cardiac sympathetic
blockade by segmental thoracic epidural anesthesia in humans.
Both in a supine position and during tilt, LF and HF spectral power
remained unchanged. Similarly, partial cardiac sympathetic dener-
vation by means of bilateral thoracic sympathectomy affected
neither LF power nor the LF/HF ratio (Noppen et al., 1996;
Tedoriya, Sakagami, Ueyama, Thompson, & Hetzer, 1999).

| term | definition |
|---|---|
| a sample space Ω | a non-empty set from which random fluctuations or outcomes ω ∈ Ω are drawn |
| external states Ψ : Ψ × A × Ω → ℝ | states of the world that cause sensory states and depend on action |
| sensory states S : Ψ × A × Ω → ℝ | the agent's sensations that constitute a probabilistic mapping from action and external states |
| action states A : S × Λ × Ω → ℝ | an agent's action that depends on its sensory and internal states |
| internal states Λ : Λ × S × Ω → ℝ | the states of the agent that cause action and depend on sensory states |
| ergodic density p(ψ, s, a, λ\|m) | a probability density function over external ψ ∈ Ψ, sensory s ∈ S, active a ∈ A and internal states λ ∈ Λ for a system denoted by m |
| variational density q(ψ\|λ) | an arbitrary probability density function over external states that is parametrized by internal states |

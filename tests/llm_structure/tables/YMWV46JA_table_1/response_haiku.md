| Term | Symbol | Definition |
|---|---|---|
| sample space | V | a non-empty set from which random fluctuations or outcomes v ∈ V are drawn |
| external states | C : C × A × V → R | states of the world that cause sensory states and depend on action |
| sensory states | S : C × A × V → R | the agent's sensations that constitute a probabilistic mapping from action and external states |
| action states | A : S × L × V → R | an agent's action that depends on its sensory and internal states |
| internal states | L : L × S × V → R | the states of the agent that cause action and depend on sensory states |
| ergodic density | p(c, s, a, l\|m) | a probability density function over external c ∈ C, sensory s ∈ S, active a ∈ A and internal states l ∈ L for a system denoted by m |
| variational density | q(c\|l) | an arbitrary probability density function over external states that is parametrized by internal states |

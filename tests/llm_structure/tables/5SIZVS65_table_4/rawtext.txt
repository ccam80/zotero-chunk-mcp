the National Polyp Study [3]. In contrast to Odom et al,
this study found more villous adenomas (3.6 %, versus
1.0 %) [9], and provides data on sessile serrated adenomas.
Information about the epidemiology of SSAs is limited.
Prevalence has been reported between 0.6–13.8 % of
resected polyps [7, 10, 11]. Coexisting adenomatous
polyps were found in nearly half of patients in one series
[11]. The present study found an intermediate prevalence
(4.5 %); 86.3 % of these patients did not have other aden-
omatous polyp types present. Some studies [7, 10], but not
all [11], have reported a female preponderance. This study
found no statistical difference by sex, in overall SSA or
within SSA types. However, amongst all 9301 patients,
prevalence of SSA was higher in females (n = 215; 5.1 %)
than in males (n = 202; 4.0 %) (p = 0.02).
This study has numerous strengths. It utilized a large,
community based sample with inclusion of significant
numbers of women and older adults. Experts in surgical
pathology interpreted all specimens, and their reports
provided greater detail than available through most epide-
miologic studies. Limitations include lack of information
about the race/ethnicity of patients, or the indications for
of age with multiple versus single polyp classification in 13,881
patients

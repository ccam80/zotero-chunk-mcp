Comb Filter Stability
The poles are listed in Table 3 and plotted in Figure 12 to illustrate the ﬁlter stability. All ﬁlters
are stable, as the absolute value is <1 in all implementations. For FIR ﬁlters, stability is given in all
cases. For IIR ﬁlters, poles closer to the origin of the unit circle are preferred in the implementation
because oscillations abate more rapidly. The selected 5 Hz Butterworth comb ﬁlter fully meets the
stability requirements.

4.2. Lowpass Filter
In this section, the parametrization of the lowpass ﬁlter, which is applied after the highpass ﬁlter,
is evaluated. For the smoothing lowpass, the architecture, runtime and implementation are equivalent
to the ﬁlter described in this section, and its parametrization is described in Section 3.4.8.
The lowpass after the highpass ﬁlter has the time constant T = 300 µs and the cutoff frequency
fC = 531 Hz. A higher fC does not sufﬁciently ﬁlter the high-frequency edges of the quantizations, and
a lower fC would markedly attenuate the EMG signal.
Lowpass Filter Stability
Since the pole at 0.75 is located within the unit circle, the ﬁlter is stable.
4.3. Highpass Filter
Figure 13 shows the highpass-ﬁltered artifacts and contraction EMG. An optimal balance of high
artifact attenuation and low EMG signal attenuation is desired. The null hypothesis that the Root Mean
Square (RMS) values and the signal loss of the contraction EMG and artifacts are normally distributed
was not rejected at a 5% signiﬁcance level. The one-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test [43] resulted in
a p = 0.9995 for the RMS of the contraction EMG and in a p = 0.0896 for the RMS of the artifacts. For the
signal loss, the p-values depend on the applied ﬁlter. The artifacts have lower p-values because the
probability density function of artifacts is skewed. The standard deviations in Figure 13c result from
the frequency characteristics of the highly variable artifacts measured. The signal loss is the difference

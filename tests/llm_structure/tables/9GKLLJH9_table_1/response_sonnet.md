*Note.* Models 1–7 are described in the text. −2 LL = the models −2 log-likelihood; *df* = the number of parameters estimated in the model; Δ-2 LL = the difference between the prior and current model; *p* = the probability of Δ-2 LL, with *p* < .05 indicating better fit of the model with more parameters; *df* = degrees of freedom.

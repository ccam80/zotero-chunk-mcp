| MDP Field | Model Element | Structure | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| MDP.xn | Neuronal encoding of hidden states. | 1 cell per state factor. Rows = iterations of message passing (16 per time point). Columns = states. Third Dimension: time point the belief is about (τ). Fourth Dimension: time point the belief is at (t). | Bayesian model average of normalized firing rates, which reflect posteriors over states at each iteration of message passing (weighted by the posterior probability of the associated policies). |
| MDP.wn | Neuronal encoding of tonic dopamine, reflecting the current value of γ. | Rows = number of iterative updates (16 per time point). For example, if there were two time points in a trial this would be 1 column with 32 rows. | This reflects the value of the expected precision of the expected free energy over policies (γ) at each iteration of updating. |
| MDP.dn | Neuronal encoding of phasic dopamine responses, reflecting the rate of change in γ. | Rows = number of iterative updates (16 per time point). For example, if there were two time points in a trial this would be 1 column with 32 rows. | This variable reflects the rate of change in the expected precision of expected free energy over policies (γ) at each iteration of updating. |
| MDP.rt | Simulated reaction times. | Columns = time points. | Computation time (i.e., time to convergence) for each round of message passing and action selection. |

yser, Logic Pro 16. For each known excitation frequency, a DTFT was
applied to 𝐼(𝑓, 𝑡), 𝑉𝐴𝑅(𝑓, 𝑡) and 𝑉𝐵𝑅(𝑓, 𝑡),

where N is the length of 𝑉𝐴𝑅(𝑓𝑘, 𝑡) and 𝛥𝑡is the sampling period. This
process was performed in MATLAB (R2019b, MathWorks) for each of
the 40 frequencies, resulting in a complex array for the two electrode
voltages and the series current. The impedance associated with the
individual electrode–skin interfaces can then be determined,

3.2. Data validation
3.2.1. Passive circuitry
To validate the efficacy of the impedance measurement method,
passive circuitry was used as a proxy device under test (DUT), Fig. 2.
The proxy DUT was designed to model a pair of single or double expo-
nential electrode–skin interfaces. However, the single exponential inter-
faces were used in this study. The proxy DUT was formed from known
component values (measured using a Tonghui TH2822E handheld LCR
meter). This permitted comparison of the theoretical impedance to the
data captured using the CIA. The theoretical impedance is given by
𝑍𝑇𝐴(𝑓) = 𝑅1 +𝑅2 ∥𝑍𝐶1 and 𝑍𝑇𝐵(𝑓) = 𝑅4 +𝑅3 ∥𝑍𝐶2, where 𝑍𝑇𝐴(𝑓) and
𝑍𝑇𝐵(𝑓) are the theoretical impedances of the first and second electrodes
respectively.
Three data sets were obtained using the CIA and the proxy DUT,
with component values outlined in Table 1. This process highlighted
Component values used for the three control DUT data sets.

3.2.2. Human subjects
To further validate human values for 𝑍𝐴CIA(𝑓) and 𝑍𝐵CIA(𝑓) ob-
tained using the CIA, a Keysight Technologies E4990A impedance
analyser (KIA) was used. The KIA has an excitation frequency range of
20 Hz–20 MHz, however, a 20 Hz–1 MHz range with 201 samples was
implemented for this study. To compare the CIA and KIA data sets,
interpolation and truncation of the data had to be performed. The KIA
data was truncated to the first data point below or equal to 100 kHz
(97.7 kHz) for the magnitude data and 10 kHz (9.5 kHz) for the phase
data. The CIA data were up-sampled using cubic spline interpolation,
then truncated. This process produced data sets that had a frequency
span of 20 Hz–97.7 kHz for the magnitude data and 20 Hz–9.5 kHz for
the phase data. Both the magnitude and phase data sets were sampled
at the same fixed frequencies for comparison.
Measuring the electrode–skin impedance at 50 Hz was avoided since
coupled mains interference can effect the measurement. The interpo-
lated data was used for 𝑍
(𝑓) and 𝑍
(𝑓) at 50 Hz Besides the

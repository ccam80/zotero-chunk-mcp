chest conditions, due to inaccurate reflection of phasic
changes in preload (and hence stroke volume), increased
aortic impedance (and subsequent changes in the relation-
ship between stroke volume and pulse pressure), as well as
less pronounced cyclic changes in intrathoracic pressure
[41,46]. Second, we adopted very strict inclusion and ex-
clusion criteria in our meta-analysis. We excluded studies
with a tidal volume <8 ml/kg. But one study [47] from
Marik and colleagues’ review and one study [48] from
Hong and colleagues’ review included tidal volume <7 ml/
kg. We excluded two studies [49,50] included by Marik
and colleagues because they reported PPV in fewer than
10 patients so that the 2 × 2 contingency table could not
be generated. In addition, two studies with contradicting
information without clarification from the authors were
also excluded [51,52]. Third, Marik and colleagues did not
find any heterogeneity using the Cochran Q statistic.
Despite the fact that two parameters were meta-analyzed
with only one Cochran’s Q statistic reported, Hong and
colleagues considered between-study heterogeneity low
enough to consider the study population as statistically
homogeneous for applying appropriate AUC statistics. We
reported borderline heterogeneity in our studies. Possible
reasons might include the different studies involved in the
meta-analysis (as mentioned above) as well as different
statistical models used. We found that the heterogeneity
observed in our meta-analysis could be fully explained by
the threshold effect, which had not been investigated in
the previous meta-analyses. The threshold effect is one of
main causes of heterogeneity in test accuracy studies. It
arises owing to different thresholds or cutoff values used
in different studies to determine a positive (or negative)
test result. The median threshold level for PPV to predict
fluid responsiveness in our meta-analysis was 12% (inter-
quartile range 10 to 13%) with a sensitivity of 0.88 and a
specificity of 0.89. The bottom line is that we believe it
would be reasonable to postulate that PPV >13% implied
fluid responsiveness, while PPV <10% indicated fluid
unresponsiveness.
To explore other potential sources of heterogeneity, we
focused on the studies with the lowest sensitivity value
and Youden index (sensitivity + specificity −1) (Figure 3).
These were also three of the four studies identified using a
Galbraith plot (Figure 4). Two of the studies were carried
out similarly by the same first author [41,42]. In the study
with larger sample size, Fischer and colleagues found that
one-third of the patients had right ventricular dysfunction
and 34% of ICU patients with PPV >12% were fluid

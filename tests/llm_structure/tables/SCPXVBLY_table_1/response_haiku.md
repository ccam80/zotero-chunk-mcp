| A matrix: p(o_τ \| s_τ) | A matrix encoding beliefs about the relationship between hidden states and observable outcomes at each time point τ (i.e., the probability that specific outcomes will be observed given specific hidden states at specific times). Note that in the POMDP structure typically used in the active inference literature (and which we describe in this tutorial), the likelihood is assumed to remain constant across time points in a trial, and hence will not differ at different values for τ (although one could adjust this if so desired). The likelihood is also assumed to be identical across policies, and so there is no indexing with respect to π. When there is more than one outcome modality, there is one A matrix per outcome modality. When there is more than one state factor these matrices become high dimensional and are | Encodes beliefs about the relationship between: 1. Probability that the hint is accurate in each context 2. Probability of reward in each context 3. Identity mapping between choice states and observed behavior |

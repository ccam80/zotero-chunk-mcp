male and 6,176 (44.5 %) female. Ages ranged from 50 to
95 years, with a mean (SD) of 62.8 (9.2) years and me-
dian of 62 years. Females were slightly older (mean age
63.3 years) than males (mean age 62.5 years) and due to
the large sample size, the difference was significant
(p < .0001). Differences in gender were seen in each
age category (Table 1).
Histopathology
Adenomatous polyps, whether singular or multiple, were
the most common pathological finding (n = 8,305; 59.9 %),
followed by hyperplastic polyps (n = 4,600; 33.1 %). In con-
trast, villous adenomas (n = 545; 3.6 %), moderate to high
grade dysplasia (n = 49; 0.4 %) and invasive carcinoma
(n = 22; 0.2 %) were rare (Table 2).

more common among males (n = 4920; 63.9 %) than
females (n = 3385; 54.9 %) (p < .0001 for comparison).
Single hyperplastic polyps more common among women
(n = 1699; 51.6 %) than men (n = 1597; 48.4 %) (p =
0.077); there was no significant difference by sex for
multiple hyperplastic polyps (p = 0.580) (Fig. 1, Table 2).
Trends in histopathology based on age were seen as
well. Adenomas were the most common finding across
all age groups, and prevalence increased with increasing
age (Fig. 2).
Between 2007 and 2012, SSAs were found in a total of
417 patients (4.5 %), (Table 3). There was no statistical
difference by sex, in overall SSA or within SSA types.
However, amongst all 9301 patients, prevalence of SSA
was higher in females (n = 215; 5.1 %) than in males (n =
202; 4.0 %) (p = 0.02). Prevalence of SSA was also greater
in patients ages 50- < 60 years than older adults (7.6 %
versus 2.0-4.3 %. p < .0001 for distribution of histology
by age) as seen in Fig. 2.
Number of polyps
Polyps were classified as single or multiple in the regis-
try. The prevalence of multiple polyps was higher in
men (n = 2,735; 35.5 %) than in women (n = 1,978;
32.0 %), p < .0001. Multiple polyps were also more com-
mon with increasing age: age 50–59 years, 32.3 %; 60–69
years, 34.3 %; 70–79 years, 36.5 %; and 80+ years, 35.7 %
(p = .001). Using age 50–59 years and sex as referent cat-
egories, the odds of having multiple (vs single) polyps

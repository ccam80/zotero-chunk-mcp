DSP Sampling Frequency fS (kHz)
SNR ()
Figure 17. SNR at different sampling frequencies. The EMG signal was measured at a muscle force at
20% of MVC and the noise was measured at a relaxed muscle. Note that the SNR is higher at 100%
MVC than at these measurements with lower muscle force.
4.9. Memory
The presented implementation including all conﬁgurations, ﬁlters, rectiﬁcation and smoothing
and the decision algorithm requires 32.4% of the 256 kB program memory and 35.3% of the 32 kB
data memory.
4.10. Signal Delay

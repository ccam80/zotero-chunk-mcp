was higher at older age, while female sex had lower odds
relative to males (Table 4). Both age and sex effects were
significant; an age by sex interaction was not found.
Location
More than half the patients had biopsy specimens iso-
lated within either the right colon (n = 3,943; 28.4 %),
the transverse colon (n = 3,288; 23.7 %), or a combin-
ation of the two (n = 864; 6.2 %) (Table 5) – regions be-
yond the reach of a sigmoidoscope. Only 29.1 % of
patients had specimens isolated to the left side of the
colon: left colon (n = 1,379; 9.9 %), sigmoid colon (n =
2,382; 17.2 %), rectum (n = 94; 0.7 %), or a combination
of these sites (n = 180; 1.3 %). A minority of patients
(n = 1,607; 11.6 %) had polyps on both the left side of
g
colon. Information about the site of the biopsy speci-
men was missing for 144 patients (1.0 %). There was
a small but statistically significant difference in distri-
bution by gender and age (Fig. 3).
Discussion
In this community based sample of adults aged 50 and
older, adenomas were the most common histopatho-
logical finding (n = 8,305; 59.9 %), with higher prevalence
in males (p < .0001) and increasing prevalence by age in
either sex (p < .0001).
Isolated hyperplastic polyps were the second most com-
mon finding (n = 4,600; 33.1 %). The presence of multiple
polyps was positively associated with male sex (p < .0001)
and increasing age (p = .001). 58.3 % of patients had no le-
sions within reach of a typical sigmoidoscope; while there
were statistically significant differences in polyp location
based on age and gender, the absolute differences were
small and unlikely to be of clinical significance.
These results differ from previous reports in several
important ways. Most studies have reported a prepon-
derance of left-sided polyps [5, 6, 8], with right-sided
ones more common in women [5]. In contrast, most pa-
tients in this study had right-sided polyps, regardless of
gender and age. In addition, few patients (n = 22; 0.2 %)
in this registry had invasive carcinoma, validating results
from Odom et al who reported a 0.3 % rate of invasive
carcinoma in single community hospital between 1999
and 2002 [9]. Other studies have found higher rates, ran-
ging from 1.1 % in a prospective four year screening
study in Austria [6], to 6 % in the enrollment phase of
the National Polyp Study [3]. In contrast to Odom et al,
this study found more villous adenomas (3.6 %, versus
9301 patients

A new method for analysing nonlinear and non-stationary data has been devel-
oped. The key part of the method is the ‘empirical mode decomposition’ method
with which any complicated data set can be decomposed into a ﬁnite and often
small number of ‘intrinsic mode functions’ that admit well-behaved Hilbert trans-
forms. This decomposition method is adaptive, and, therefore, highly eﬃcient. Since
the decomposition is based on the local characteristic time scale of the data, it is
applicable to nonlinear and non-stationary processes. With the Hilbert transform,
the ‘instrinic mode functions’ yield instantaneous frequencies as functions of time
that give sharp identiﬁcations of imbedded structures. The ﬁnal presentation of the
results is an energy–frequency–time distribution, designated as the Hilbert spectrum.
In this method, the main conceptual innovations are the introduction of ‘intrinsic
mode functions’ based on local properties of the signal, which makes the instanta-
neous frequency meaningful; and the introduction of the instantaneous frequencies
for complicated data sets, which eliminate the need for spurious harmonics to rep-
resent nonlinear and non-stationary signals. Examples from the numerical results of
the classical nonlinear equation systems and data representing natural phenomena
are given to demonstrate the power of this new method. Classical nonlinear system
data are especially interesting, for they serve to illustrate the roles played by the
nonlinear and non-stationary eﬀects in the energy–frequency–time distribution.

Objective: To measure the magnitude and phase imbalance of the electrode–skin interface for silver/silver
chloride (Ag/AgCl) and silver (Ag) electrode pairs, highlighting the need to balance both the magnitude and
phase of the electrode–skin interface.
Methods: The electrode–skin impedance imbalance between two electrodes placed on ten healthy subjects was
recorded over a frequency range of 1 Hz–100 kHz, using three electrode configurations: Ag/AgCl electrodes
without skin preparation (Ag/AgClNSP), Ag/AgCl electrodes with skin preparation (Ag/AgClSP), and Ag
electrodes with skin preparation (Ag-SP). A compensation network was developed to simulate impedance
imbalance reduction using the experimental data.
Results: The mean electrode–skin impedance imbalance at 50 Hz was (37.6 ± 47.1) k𝛺and (15.0 ± 18.3)
degrees using the Ag/AgClNSP electrode configuration; (4.52 ± 7.65) k𝛺and (4.6 ± 6.9) degrees using the
Ag/AgClSP electrode configuration; and (36.2 ± 45.1) k𝛺and (3.4 ± 3.6) degrees using the Ag-SP electrode
configuration. The compensation network resulted in a mean reduction in impedance imbalance over the
bioelectrical signal range (1 Hz–500 Hz) of 284.3 k𝛺and 11.9 degrees; 4.6 k𝛺and 6.2 degrees; 86.7 k𝛺and
2.5 degrees for the Ag/AgClNSP, Ag/AgClSP and Ag-SP electrode configurations respectively.
Conclusion: This study confirmed that the electrode–skin impedance imbalance can be large, and varies
between subjects. Although abrasive skin preparation reduces the electrode–skin impedance imbalance, it does
not guarantee a balanced electrode–skin interface, therefore, balancing the electrode–skin impedance using a
compensation network has the potential to decrease bioelectrical signal interference.
Significance: As bioelectrical signal interference is a function of electrode–skin impedance imbalance, to
improve noise immunity of bioelectrical signal recordings, added compensatory impedance is required to
balance the electrode–skin interface.
1. Introduction
Bioelectrical instrumentation is used to measure weak bioelec-
trical signals. However, these signals can be contaminated by sev-
eral forms of interference: mains supply (common-mode) interfer-
ence, mains supply (differential-mode) interference due to common-
mode conversion, and bioelectrical crosstalk from signals generated
by sources in close proximity. Therefore, bioelectrical instrumentation
requires a high common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR) to suppress
common-mode noise [1]. This requires well matched circuitry. How-
ever, well matched circuitry is difficult to achieve due to imbalances
between the individual electrode–skin interfaces [2,3]. An impedance
mismatch will result in common-mode interference being converted
many bioelectrical recording techniques (e.g. electromyography (EMG),
electroencephalography (EEG) and electrocardiography (ECG)), this
paper focuses on surface electromyography (sEMG).
Displacement and conduction currents flow through the electrode
leads due to being capacitively coupled to the AC mains power sup-
ply [2,3,5]. Since the recording device has a high input impedance, the
displacement and conduction currents will flow through the electrode–
skin interface and to ground through a reference electrode. The re-
sulting differential-mode voltage is proportional to the imbalance of
the electrode–skin impedance, and becomes superimposed with the
bioelectrical signal.
Crosstalk in sEMG is the phenomenon of one muscle’s signal influ-

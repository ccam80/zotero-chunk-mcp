individual studies (i.e. diagnosis in symptomatic patients,
screening for average or high risk, or surveillance with
personal history of polyposis). Some patients may have
also been included more than once, if they underwent re-
peat colonoscopies in the ten year period.
Conclusions
Right-sided and transverse polyps were more common in
this community-based registry than previously reported,
supporting whole-colon screening (e.g. colonoscopy) as
opposed to regional evaluation (e.g. sigmoidoscopy).
Invasive carcinoma was rare, but villous adenomas
more
common
than
in
another
community-based
study [9]. Sessile serrated adenomas were uncommon
(n = 417, 4.5 %), with greater prevalence in women
than men (5.1 % vs 4 %, p = 0.02) and adults aged
50- < 60 years (Fig. 2), warrant endoscopist vigilance
for flat lesions in these populations.

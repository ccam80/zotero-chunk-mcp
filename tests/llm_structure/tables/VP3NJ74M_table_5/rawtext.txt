electrode–skin impedance, it does not guarantee a balanced electrode–
skin interface. This is highlighted when comparing the impedance
imbalance at 50 Hz and over the bioelectrical signal range.
Multiple methods were applied to reduce limitations of this study.
During skin preparation, approximately 20 light uniform sweeps over
a large area above the biceps brachii were performed. This reduced
the possibility of skin preparation producing an impedance imbal-
ance. To ensure the electrode adhesive and gel did not effect the
impedance measurements between the different electrode configura-
tions, the Ag/AgClNSP electrode–skin impedance was measured on the
right arm, and the Ag/AgClSP electrode–skin impedance was measured
on the left arm. This does have the limitation that the impedance

Figure 3. Block diagram outlining the insulated EMG measurement set-up. First, the EMG signal
coupled from the human body is ampliﬁed and ﬁltered by the analog circuit. In the µC, the signal is
then digitally ﬁltered and provided at the sensor system output.

3.1. Interface to Human Body
Due to the insulating layer, the ﬂexible sensing electrode has no conductive connection to the skin.
This sensor is a multilayer construct made of textiles, foils or a ﬂex circuit board. In this work, the
measurements were performed with the foil sensor. The sensor area is shielded with a common-mode
shield to increase the common-mode rejection ratio and to protect against noise from the environment.
A small conductive reference made of textile connects the sensor electronics to the electrical potential
of the body. This reference keeps the common-mode potential of the sensor input ampliﬁer within
operating range.
For the measurements presented in this article, the EMG sensor was placed at the musculus
extensor digitorum, at one third of the distance between the epicondylus lateralis and the ulna. This
muscle was selected for the experiments as a large proportion of upper-limb amputations are at
trans-radial level or are farther distal [25–28].
3.2. Analog Circuit
The analog signal, which is coupled via the EMG sensing electrode, is ampliﬁed by the
instrumentation ampliﬁer by a gain of 26. The bandpass is formed by a ﬁrst-order analog highpass
and lowpass ﬁlter. The highpass has a cutoff frequency of 11 Hz to attenuate the low-frequency noise,
and the lowpass has a cutoff frequency of 1064 Hz to ﬁlter the high-frequency noise. The signal is
further ampliﬁed by the µC’s internal operational ampliﬁers (OpAmps) by software-programmable
gain. This gain factor is varied to exploit the full operating range at the ADC input. For this work,
the gain of the internal OpAmps was varied in the range of 4 to 128, depending on the experiment
(noise for comb measurements 128, EMG signal and noise for signal to noise ratio measurements

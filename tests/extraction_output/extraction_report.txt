      Caption: Figure 1. Simulated P-waves of the 12-lead ECG with various atrial shapes, several orientations of the atria inside the torso and a variety of body shapes. The colors represent the total atrial volume in blue, the torso size in red and the orientation angle around the medial-lateral axis in orange [50]. 2. Modeling the ECG of a Healthy Heart 2.1. The QRS Complex and the Purkinje Tree The morphology of the QRS complex is strongly determined by the topology of the His-Purkinje system in the ventricular subendocardial layer [2]. An earlier approach to ﬁt a Punkinje network model to a measured ECG was published by Keller et al. in 2009 [1]. In total, 744 Purkinje muscle junctions were distributed across the ventricular endocardial surface following speciﬁc rules. Other publications followed this scheme and implemented “root points” coupled to thin endocardial layers with very fast conduction [3]

Examples of ischemic regions with varying transmural extent due to occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery and the related levels of hyperkalemia, acidosis, and hypoxia (A). ECG lead V4 for ischemia of varying transmural extent in temporal stage 2 (B) and varying duration of a transmural ischemia (C). Ventricular transmembrane voltage and body surface potential distribution during the action potential plateau (t = 200 ms) for ischemia of varying transmural extent in stage 2 (D). The QRS complex was not optimized in this study. (Images reproduced with permission from [28].) Ledezma et al. created populations of control and ischemic cell strands and observed the corresponding pseudo-ECGs (which is the voltage between two virtual electrodes at or near to the ends of a tissue strand immersed in an inﬁnite homogeneous volume conductor).

      Caption: Figure 3. Modeling of ectopic beats and the corresponding ECG: for three different trigger locations in the right ventricle (RV) and left ventricle (LV), the transmembrane voltage (left column), the extra- cellular potentials (middle column) and corresponding ECGs (right column) are shown. Excitation propagation was computed by solving the anisotropic Eikonal equation. 3.4. Cardiomyopathy Lyon et al. investigated ECG phenotypes resulting from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy using computer modeling [36]. The objective was to better identify patients at high risk of sudden cardiac death. An inverted T-wave with normal QRS was obtained with increased apico-basal repolarization gradients in the septum and the apex. Lateral QRS abnormalities were only obtained with abnormal Purkinje-myocardium coupling.

      Caption: Figure 4. Examples of simulated AFlut transmembrane voltage distributions and the corresponding BSPMs and 12-lead ECGs. Top row: AFlut around the tricuspid valve in the counter-clockwise direction. Bottom row: ﬁgure-8 macro-re-entry around the left and right pulmonary veins in the anterior direction of rotation [45]. Atrial ﬁbrillation remains a challenge regarding the relation of ECG features with patterns of depolarization. In case several (more than three) re-entry mechanisms are active simultaneously, it will probably be impossible to discriminate them from the ECG only. Rodrigo et al. used BSPMs computed in personalized torso models and found that areas of high dominant frequency and areas of large rotors can be localized [48]. However, as mentioned before, this is not the setting of classical ECG interpretation. Nevertheless, if only one ectopic center or one rotor is the driver of AFib, then important characteristics

      Caption: Fig. 1. Schematic diagram of the mathematical model for the baroreflex feedback control of heart rate (HR). Four submodels have been developed: an afferent baroreceptor nerve firing model, a model predicting sympathetic and parasympathetic outcomes, including the input from the vestibular system, a model predicting concentrations of norepinephrine and acetylcholine, and a model for HR.

Results are shown for a representative young subject (A), healthy elderly subject (B), and hypertensive subject (C). The subject stands up at time t �60 s, indicated on the graphs by the dotted vertical line.

      Caption: Fig. 4. The graphs show afferent baroreflex firing rate n as a function of mean blood pressure (pbar). Results are shown from a healthy young subject (A), healthy elderly subject (B), and hypertensive elderly subject (C). Solid lines through the hysteresis loops show the sixth-degree polynomial used to calcu- late the area of the hysteresis loops. Dashed lines through the hysteresis curves are used to determine the overall slopes of the hysteresis curves. Average values for areas and slopes are given in Table 3.

The dotted line indicates where the blood pressure is starting to decrease; simultaneous HR and blood pressure are shown in Fig. 7. On the figures, text and errors indicate contri- butions from vestibular-sympathetic activation, parasympathetic withdrawal, and sympathetic activation. Our HR model is able to reproduce measured data extremely well for all three groups of subjects (the least squares errors are J � 9.93, J �2.18, and J �1.59 for A, B, and C, respectively). bpm, Beats per minute.

      Caption: Fig. 9. Parameter permutation. A: results of making a young (Y) subject elderly; B: results of making a healthy elderly (HE) subject hypertensive. As input, we used blood pressures from the Y and HE subjects, respectively (see Fig. 2, A and B), and parameters followed those predicted for the HE (A) and hypertensive elderly (HyE; B) subjects. For these simulations, we modified parameters if the difference between the Y (A) and HE (B) and the HE (A) and HyE (B) subjects varied �50%. a: Ts and Tp. Dashed lines show results with permutated parameters, and solid lines show results from original computations for the HE (A) and HyE (B) subjects, respectively (see also Fig. 5). b: firing rate n as a function of blood pressure. The solid lines show results with permuted parameters, and the gray lines show results for HE (A) and HyE (B) subjects, respectively (see also Fig. 4). c: Computed HR using permuted and original parameters plotted against HR data. Here, dashed and gray lines show results with permuted parameters, and solid and gray lines show computed results (using original parameters) for the HE (A) and HyE (B) subjects (see also Fig. 8). These are plotted against HR data (dark solid and dashed lines). All simulations showed that the model-based predicted responses closely matched the measured and model-based computed responses (using original parameters). The main difference is that, in these simulations, the hysteresis loops are not shifted to the right with an adequate amount. This is mainly due to the fact that the input pressure stems from Y and HE subjects, respectively.

"""Cell extraction methods test entry point.

Individual method tests live in their own files:
- test_cell_rawdict.py  -- rawdict extraction
- test_cell_words.py    -- word assignment extraction

Run all cell method tests via:
    pytest tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_rawdict.py
    pytest tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_words.py

Or run both:
    pytest tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_rawdict.py tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_words.py

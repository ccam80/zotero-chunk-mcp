"""Cell extraction methods test entry point.

Individual method tests live in their own files:
- test_cell_rawdict.py  -- rawdict extraction (Task 5.4.1)
- test_cell_words.py    -- word assignment extraction (Task 5.4.2)
- test_cell_pdfminer.py -- PDFMiner extraction (Task 5.4.3)

This file exists to satisfy the spec's test file naming convention.
Run all cell method tests via:
    pytest tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_rawdict.py
    pytest tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_words.py
    pytest tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_pdfminer.py

Or run all three:
    pytest tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_rawdict.py tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_words.py tests/test_feature_extraction/test_cell_pdfminer.py

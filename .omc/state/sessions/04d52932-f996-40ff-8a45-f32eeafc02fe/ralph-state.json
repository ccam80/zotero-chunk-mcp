  "original_prompt": "this library has undergone a significant refactor, and it's time to take out the trash. start a ralph loop, deleting piece of source code not used in the production feature extraction / pdf processing pileline or an mcp tool, and every test which tests these features. there is a bunch of debug scaffolding - keep the debug and vision databases and viewers, otherwise get rid of every one-off test script or file. One test file per surviving source file can remain, and no tests inside it can be duplicates. Being used in a test file does not mean code is live. Tests may be moved between test files.",
